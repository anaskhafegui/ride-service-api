Here‚Äôs a clean, professional `README.md` to help you document and onboard others to your **Trip Dispatching Module** using **NestJS + PostgreSQL** with **DDD + CQRS + Event-Driven Architecture**:

## üöñ Trip Dispatching Service (NestJS + PostgreSQL)

A modular monolithic backend service that manages trip lifecycle in a ride-hailing application.  
Implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and event-based flows to dispatch trips, assign drivers, estimate fares, and handle payments.

---

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with PostGIS for geospatial queries)
- **ORM**: TypeORM or Prisma (your choice)
- **Architecture**: Modular Monolith, DDD, CQRS
- **Patterns**: Event Sourcing (CQRS Events), Domain Aggregates, Value Objects

## üß† Modules

| Module     | Purpose                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trip`     | Manages trip lifecycle using rich domain aggregates       |
| `dispatch` | Handles retryable driver matching with expanding radius   |
| `driver`   | Stores driver availability and real-time location         |
| `payment`  | Authorizes and captures trip fares                        |
| `pricing`  | Estimates trip fares based on service area, car, distance |

---

## üß± Domain Structure

- **Aggregate Root**: `Trip`
- **Value Objects**: `Coordinates`, `FareAmount`, `CarType`, `ServiceType`, `PricingType`, `TripStatus`, `ScheduledTime`
- **Entities**: `Trip`
- **Domain Events**:
  - `TripRequestedEvent`
  - `DriverAcceptedTripEvent`
  - `TripAcceptedEvent`
  - `FareAuthorizedEvent`
- **Use Cases** (Commands & Queries): Cleanly separated by responsibility

## üó∫ PostgreSQL + PostGIS Setup

This project uses PostGIS to perform geospatial lookups (e.g., nearest driver):

1. Enable PostGIS on your PostgreSQL instance:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
```

2. Example for storing driver location:

```sql
location geography(Point, 4326)
```

3. Searching for drivers within radius (TypeORM):

```ts
ST_DWithin(
  driver.location,
  ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(:lng, :lat), 4326)::geography,
  :radiusInMeters
)
```

## üß™ Example Trip Dispatch Flow

1. Passenger requests trip ‚Üí emits `TripRequestedEvent`
2. `DispatchService`:
   - Starts with 5km radius
   - Notifies `ready_for_order` drivers
   - Waits for `DriverAcceptedTripEvent`
   - Retries up to N times with growing radius
3. Driver accepts ‚Üí `TripAcceptedEvent` emitted
4. `TripService`:
   - Estimates fare via `PricingService`
   - Authorizes via `PaymentService`
   - Saves updated trip

---

## üìÅ Example `.env`

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/rides
TRIP_ACCEPTANCE_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
TRIP_DISPATCH_MAX_RETRIES=3
TRIP_DISPATCH_EXPAND_RADIUS_KM=5
```

---

## ‚úÖ Todos

- [ ] Implement `TripRepository` using TypeORM or Prisma
- [ ] Integrate with external notification service (e.g., Firebase, sockets)
- [ ] Add real-time location tracking for drivers
- [ ] Capture fare at trip end with fallback logic (outstanding balance)

---

## üöÄ Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Contributing

Open to contributions ‚Äî just follow the DDD structure and split commands/queries/events properly.
